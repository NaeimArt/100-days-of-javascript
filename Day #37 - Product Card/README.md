### Product Card
In this tutorial ([Open in Youtube](https://youtu.be/rmRn2_BCdF0)), 
This project is a simple web page displaying a product card for a Nike hoodie. Users can choose the hoodie color and size, add a desired quantity to their cart, and view the final price. The web page is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for adding user interactions.❗️
